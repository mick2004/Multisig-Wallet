# 🏦 Multisig Wallet Project

This project implements a multisig wallet, designed to enhance security by requiring multiple signatures for transaction approval. The repository is organized into two main directories: `frontend` and `backend`.

## 📚 Introduction

A multisig (multiple signature) wallet requires more than one private key to authorize a transaction. This increases security by distributing trust among multiple parties. Our implementation leverages SolidJS for the frontend to provide a reactive and efficient user interface, and uses Solidity for the smart contract development in the backend, ensuring robust and secure blockchain interactions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine. You will find two main folders: `backend` for the smart contracts and backend-related functionality, and `frontend` for the web application interface.

### Prerequisites

- 📦 Node.js installed on your machine
- 🖥 A code editor like VSCode
- 📘 Basic knowledge of Solidity and JavaScript

### Installation

First, install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
# For frontend
cd frontend
npm install

# For backend
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## 💻 Usage

### Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
```

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will serve the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173), where it can be viewed in the browser.

To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the SolidJS app into static files in the `dist` folder, ready for deployment.

### Backend

The `backend` directory contains the Solidity smart contracts and deployment scripts. To deploy the contracts to a local blockchain for testing (e.g., using Hardhat or Truffle), navigate to the `backend` directory and run:

```bash
# Using Hardhat
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

## 🌐 Deployment

For frontend deployment, refer to the Vite documentation on static deployment. The backend contracts can be deployed to a testnet or mainnet, depending on your project's needs. Be sure to test thoroughly before deploying to a live blockchain network.
